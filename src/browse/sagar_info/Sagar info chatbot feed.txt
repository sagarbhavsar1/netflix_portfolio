Summary
I believe in the power of data and technology to transform ideas
into impactful solutions. My journey has been shaped by a love for
problem-solving, analytics, and a knack for Ai.
I’m Sagar, a recent Master’s graduate from NYU Stern and Courant,
with a background in Computer Science and Information Systems.
With over 2 years of experience building intelligent systems that
bridge business and technology, with a focus on data science, AI,
and full stack- real-time analytics.
Currently at Julius as a data Scientist, where I analyze large scale
labour market datasets and design clustering workflows on more
than 2M datapoints using BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Python based
embedding methods. I also create dashboards on Looker Studio that
help teams understand emerging skills and industry trends.
My past experience spans across projects involving computer
vision, deep learning, and financial NLP. I’ve architected chatbots,
enhanced image-processing pipelines, and built AI systems that turn
raw data into strategic insights.
Outside of tech, I’ve competed in table tennis at the national level,
a decade-long pursuit that’s sharpened my focus, adaptability, and
ability to perform under pressure.
Let’s connect if you're building something that needs clean data,
smart systems, and someone who’s excited to contribute.
